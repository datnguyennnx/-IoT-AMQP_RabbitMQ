Our team is focused on how we can create a simple system for "Producer-Broker-Consumer" communication using the RabbitMQ model, and our main programming language is Python. We created simulation and execution on the hardware with AMQP. We will deploy this simulator on the Rasberry Pi 4 and show you how it works.

Application: A simple model of how customers can choose a 4-seater or 7-seater car service through the queue to catch a taxi. We have a diagram for the RabbitMQ model to clearly express our idea.
